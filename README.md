### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a former architect (buildings!) turned web developer based in NJ. I specialize in building JavaScript full-stack web applications with React and Express.

Currently, I'm helping to democratize opportunity at [@handshake](https://github.com/joinhandshake). I'm also building [Viewport](https://www.viewport.xyz/), a lightweight 3D model viewer and sharer.

Always open to collaborate! [Drop me a line.](mailto:hi@jeffreyclu.com)
